Feature Request: Accessible File Upload System

Objective:
Develop a user-friendly and fully accessible file upload system optimized for visually impaired users utilizing screen readers.

Key Functionalities:

Accessible Upload Button:

Clearly labeled "Upload File" button with ARIA attributes (aria-label="Upload File").

Keyboard focusable (tab navigation enabled).

Clickable and keyboard-activated (Enter & Space key support).

Drag-and-Drop Alternative:

Provide a button-based alternative to drag-and-drop functionality.

Ensure screen readers announce "Drop files here or use the upload button."

File Selection & Upload Progress:

Open native file selection dialog when activated.

Announce selected file name and upload status via ARIA live regions (aria-live="polite").

Display progress as a percentage.

Project Metadata Input:

Accessible input fields for:

Title (labeled, focusable, and screen reader-friendly).

Description (multiline text area with proper labels).

Tags (keyboard-navigable with ARIA feedback for selections).

Confirmation & Error Handling:

Announce successful upload confirmation via ARIA live regions.

Provide descriptive error messages (e.g., "File format not supported").

Ensure error messages are focusable and read automatically.

Publishing Process:

Clearly labeled "Publish" button.

Announce final status (e.g., "Project published successfully").

Ensure all actions can be performed via keyboard.

Additional Accessibility Enhancements:

Ensure all interactive elements have sufficient color contrast.

Provide an option to add alt text for images.

Support for high-contrast mode and screen magnifiers.

Technology Stack Recommendation:

Frontend: React/Vue with ARIA support.

File Upload Handling: AWS S3, Firebase Storage, or a custom Node.js backend.

Accessibility Testing: Use tools like Axe, Lighthouse, and NVDA/JAWS screen readers for validation.

Expected Outcome:
A seamless, accessible file upload experience that ensures blind users can independently upload, describe, and publish their content without barriers.
